a minimal-ish config for awesomewm with a focus on verticality. 
Other than the modularized config most changes are just tweaks to make the vertical bars work and look pretty in both tiled and floating (in floating titlebars are added and windows rounded, both features disable again in tiled).

this is intended to be run alongside the picom.conf
file in the directory above.
